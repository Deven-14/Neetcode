You are given two integers n and x. You have to construct an array of positive integers nums of size n where for every 0 <= i < n - 1, nums[i + 1] is greater than nums[i], and the result of the bitwise AND operation between all elements of nums is x.

Return the minimum possible value of nums[n - 1].

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, x = 2

Output: 6
Explanation: nums can be [2,3,6].

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, x = 3

Output: 19
Explanation: nums can be [3,7,11,15,19].

Constraints:

1 <= n, x <= 100,000,000
