You are given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: 4
Explanation: 4 = 2 + 2, 2 x 2 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: n = 12

Output: 81
Explanation: 12 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81.

Constraints:
