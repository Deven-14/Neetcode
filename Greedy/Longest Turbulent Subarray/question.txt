You are given an integer array arr, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of arr.

A subarray is turbulent if the comparison sign flips between each adjacent pair of elements in the subarray.

More formally, a subarray [arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]] of arr is said to be turbulent if and only if:

For i <= k < j:
arr[k] > arr[k + 1] when k is odd, and
arr[k] < arr[k + 1] when k is even.
Or, for i <= k < j:
arr[k] > arr[k + 1] when k is even, and
arr[k] < arr[k + 1] when k is odd.
Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,4,3,2,2,5,1,4]

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest turbulent subarray is [2,5,1,4].

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,1,2]

Output: 2
Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 40,000
0 <= arr[i] <= 1,000,000,000
