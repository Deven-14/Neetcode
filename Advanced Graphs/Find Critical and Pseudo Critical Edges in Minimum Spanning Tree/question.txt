You are given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [a[i], b[i], weight[i]] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes a[i] and b[i]. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,3,2],[0,2,5],[1,2,4]]

Output: [[0,2,1],[]]
Example 2:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,3,2],[0,4,2],[1,3,2],[3,4,2],[2,3,1],[1,2,3],[0,1,1]]

Output: [[4,6],[0,1,2,3]]
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 3
0 <= a[i] < b[i] < n
1 <= weight[i] <= 1000
All pairs (a[i], b[i]) are distinct.
